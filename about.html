<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p>
Student Tax Studio is a student-built educational project designed to help college students understand federal income tax basics.
</p>

<p>
Many students earn part-time income, freelance income, or internship pay but are unsure whether they need to file taxes or how refunds work.
This tool simplifies that process.
</p>

<p>
This platform estimates federal income tax using standard deduction and bracket logic.
It is not tax advice and does not replace professional services.
</p>

<p>
The goal is clarity, confidence, and better financial literacy among college students.
