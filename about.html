<h1>About Student Tax Studio</h1>
<p>
Student Tax Studio is an educational project designed to help college students better understand federal taxes.
Many students enter the workforce without clear knowledge of how filing status, deductions, and withholding work.
This platform simplifies federal tax calculations using 2025 tax rules and presents them in a transparent format.
It is intended for learning purposes only and should not replace professional tax advice.
