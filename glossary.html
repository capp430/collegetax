<h2 style="margin-top:40px;">How To File Taxes</h2>
<p>Gather your W-2, any 1099 forms, and your Social Security number. Choose a filing platform such as IRS Free File, TurboTax, FreeTaxUSA, or H&R Block. Enter income information carefully, review deductions, and submit electronically. You may receive a refund if you overpaid or owe if insufficient tax was withheld.</p>
