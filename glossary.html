<h1>Tax Glossary & Filing Guide</h1>
<p>This page explains the key terms used in the calculator and walks you through how federal and state tax filing works for college students.</p>

<div class="glossary-grid">

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>W-2 Form</h3>
<p>A W-2 is issued by your employer at the end of the year. It reports total wages earned (Box 1) and how much federal income tax was withheld (Box 2). It may also show Social Security and Medicare taxes paid. You need this form to file your federal return.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>1099 Form</h3>
<p>If you worked freelance or contract jobs, you may receive a 1099 form instead of a W-2. Taxes are usually NOT withheld from 1099 income, which means you may owe taxes at filing time.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>Filing Status</h3>
<p>Your tax category (Single, Head of Household, etc.). Filing status affects your standard deduction and tax brackets. Most college students file as Single unless they qualify as Head of Household.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>Standard Deduction (2025)</h3>
<p>A fixed IRS amount that reduces taxable income. For 2025, the standard deduction is higher than prior years due to inflation adjustments. Most students use the standard deduction instead of itemizing.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>Taxable Income</h3>
<p>Your income after subtracting the standard deduction. Federal income tax is calculated on this remaining amount.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>Marginal Tax Rate</h3>
<p>The tax rate applied to your last dollar earned. The U.S. tax system is progressive, meaning income is taxed in layers or “brackets.”</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>Withholding</h3>
<p>Money your employer already sent to the IRS throughout the year. If too much was withheld, you receive a refund. If too little was withheld, you may owe money.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>Self-Employment Tax</h3>
<p>If you earn freelance income, you may owe self-employment tax (15.3%) to cover Social Security and Medicare contributions.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>Dependent</h3>
<p>If someone claims you as a dependent (often a parent), it may affect certain credits and eligibility. However, you may still need to file your own return.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-card">
<h3>Refund vs Amount Owed</h3>
<p>A refund means you paid more in withholding than your actual tax liability. Owing means your withholding did not cover your tax responsibility.</p>
</div>

<h2>State Income Taxes</h2>

<p>In addition to federal taxes, many states require their own income tax filing. State tax rules vary widely.</p>

<p><strong>States with NO state income tax:</strong><br>
Texas, Florida, Nevada, Washington, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska.</p>

<p>All other states generally have some form of income tax. This matters because:</p>

<ul>
<li>You may need to file a separate state return.</li>
<li>State withholding appears on your W-2.</li>
<li>Refunds or amounts owed may differ between federal and state filings.</li>
<li>Some states have flat tax rates, others use progressive brackets.</li>
</ul>

<p>This calculator estimates federal income tax only. State filing requirements must be checked separately.</p>
