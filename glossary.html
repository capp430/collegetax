        <h3>W-2 Form</h3>
        <p>
          A W-2 is issued by your employer and reports your total wages earned and
          federal/state taxes withheld during the year. You use this form to enter
          income and withholding when filing your tax return.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gloss-card">
        <h3>Standard Deduction</h3>
        <p>
          A fixed IRS amount that reduces taxable income before tax is calculated.
          Most college students use the standard deduction rather than itemizing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gloss-card">
        <h3>Taxable Income</h3>
        <p>
          The amount remaining after deductions that is actually taxed
          using federal tax brackets.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gloss-card">
        <h3>Withholding</h3>
        <p>
          Taxes taken out of your paycheck during the year.
          If too much is withheld, you receive a refund.
          If too little is withheld, you may owe money.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gloss-card">
        <h3>Self-Employment Income</h3>
        <p>
          Income earned from freelance or contract work (often reported on a 1099).
          This income is subject to both income tax and self-employment tax.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gloss-card">
        <h3>Marginal Tax Rate</h3>
        <p>
          The rate applied to your last dollar earned.
          The U.S. uses progressive brackets, meaning higher income
          portions are taxed at higher rates.
        </p>

    <h2>State Income Taxes</h2>

    <p>
      In addition to federal taxes, many states require their own income tax filing.
      State tax rules vary widely and may use different brackets or flat rates.
    </p>

    <div class="state-box">
      <strong>States with NO state income tax:</strong><br>
      Texas, Florida, Nevada, Washington, Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska.
    </div>

    <p>
      Why this matters:
    </p>

    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>You may need to file a separate state return.</li>
      <li>State withholding appears on your W-2.</li>
      <li>Refunds or amounts owed may differ between federal and state filings.</li>
      <li>Some states use flat taxes, others use progressive brackets.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This calculator estimates federal income tax only.
      State filing requirements must be checked separately.
