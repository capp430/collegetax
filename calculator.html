  <h3>Notes & Important Tax Topics</h3>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Capital Gains — short-term vs long-term</strong></summary>
    <div class="note-body">
      <p>
        Capital gains arise when you sell an investment (stock, ETF, crypto, etc.) for more than you paid.
        <strong>Short-term gains</strong> (assets held one year or less) are taxed as ordinary income using the regular federal tax brackets.
        <strong>Long-term gains</strong> (assets held longer than one year) are generally taxed at special preferential rates (commonly 0%, 15%, or 20%),
        depending on your total taxable income. Long-term capital gains are calculated after you've applied deductions and other income.
        If you have capital gains, they can change which tax bracket thresholds apply to you and may reduce or eliminate the 0% long-term rate.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        If you have gains and losses, net them: losses offset gains and might offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income in a year (excesses carry forward).
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Itemized Deductions (vs. Standard Deduction)</strong></summary>
    <div class="note-body">
      <p>
        The calculator uses the <em>standard deduction</em> because it is simpler and most students use it.
        Itemizing means listing eligible expenses—such as mortgage interest (if you have it), sizable medical expenses (subject to thresholds),
        state and local taxes (SALT rules may limit this), and qualified charitable donations—on Schedule A.
        If your total itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction, itemizing may lower your taxable income further.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Itemizing is more complex and often requires receipts and documentation. For most students, the standard deduction remains the easier and better choice.
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Taxable Scholarships, Grants, & Tuition Reporting</strong></summary>
    <div class="note-body">
      <p>
        Portions of scholarships and grants may be taxable. Generally:
        <ul>
          <li>Scholarship amounts used for <strong>qualified education expenses</strong> (tuition, required fees, course materials) are <em>usually</em> not taxable.</li>
          <li>Amounts used for <strong>non-qualified expenses</strong> such as room & board, travel, or optional equipment are typically taxable.</li>
        </ul>
        Schools commonly issue Form <code>1098-T</code> to report tuition paid and scholarships. If you received taxable scholarship funds, include them as income (often shown on the 1098-T or school statements).
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        When in doubt, keep records from your school and review IRS guidance (or ask a tax pro). Taxable scholarship income increases your total income and may affect credits and phaseouts.
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Other useful notes (credits, filing, and forms)</strong></summary>
    <div class="note-body">
      <p>
        <strong>American Opportunity Credit (AOTC)</strong>: a credit that can reduce tax dollar-for-dollar for eligible students (partially refundable). This calculator provides a simplified flag for a tuition credit — real eligibility depends on income limits, enrollment status, and other rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key forms:</strong> W-2 (wages & withholding), 1099-NEC / 1099-MISC (contract/freelance income), 1099-INT (interest), 1098-T (tuition). Keep these documents when filing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Filing deadline & penalties:</strong> Federal returns are generally due in April each year. Filing late or paying late can trigger penalties and interest. If you can’t pay, file on time and arrange a payment plan to reduce penalties.
